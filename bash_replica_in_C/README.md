This project is about creating bash(shell) in C using execvp command.
This shell.c file will have two working modes
1- Interactive mode
2-Batch mode
Interactive Mode:
                This mode will work as normal shell take a command a give result as normal bash do in Linux. And my shell will also work on builtin Commands like 
                cd, exit, help. and other commands like ls,pwd,echo, cat,mkdir etc.
              
Batch Mode:
          Batch mode like Interactive mode works with all the commands but it takes commands from a file passed as parameter in out file name.
